# Frontline Femmes

Frontline Femmes is a community specifically for women, femmes, and queer folks who play Squad, other teamwork-based shooters, and strategy games to gather. It's not a clan or any sort of formal organization, just a Discord community to let a small, unique group of players find & connect with each other.

Since the original post here in r/PlaySquad a year ago, we've grown to 150+ members across a wide variety of servers and communities. We've also started a Server Directory project where our members can submit their experiences on various servers (and we maintain a rating on how well those servers create a welcoming environment for women & queer players).

This Github organization represents our more tech-inclined members; we'll host projects here that contribute to both FF and the broader communities we're a part of, as well as our web presence.

### Current Projects

- [discord-cbl](https://github.com/Frontline-Femmes/discord-cbl): A Discord bot designed to check the Community Ban List (CBL) history for a given SteamID. The bot uses GraphQL to fetch data from the Community Ban List and provides detailed information about a user's reputation, risk rating, and ban history.
